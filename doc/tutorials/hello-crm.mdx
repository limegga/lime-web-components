# Hello, CRM!

While our hello-world component might be great, it does not do much to interact with the webclient. This tutorial is a continuation of the first tutorial, and aims to create a more advanced component than hello-world.

## A new component

Create a new component with `lime-project`

```sh
lime-project generate web-component hello-crm
```

Just as with our first component, we can remove most of the code in `src\components\lwc-limepkg-my-plugin-hello-crm\lwc-limepkg-my-plugin-hello-crm.tsx` and add more as needed. To get started, our component should look like this.

```tsx
import { Component, Element, Prop } from '@stencil/core';
import { LimeWebComponent, LimeWebComponentContext, LimeWebComponentPlatform } from '@limetech/lime-web-components-interfaces';

@Component({
    tag: 'lwc-limepkg-my-plugin-hello-crm',
    shadow: true
})
export class HelloCrm implements LimeWebComponent {
    @Prop()
    public platform: LimeWebComponentPlatform;

    @Prop()
    public context: LimeWebComponentContext;

    @Element()
    public element: HTMLElement;

    public render() {
        return 'Hello, CRM!';
    }
}
```

Let's also add it in `lwc.config.json` to the same slot as hello-world so we can view it in the webclient.

```json
[
    ...
    {
        "name": "lwc-limepkg-my-plugin-hello-crm",
        "slot": "object.card.head.panels"
    }
]
```

## Conditional rendering

At the moment, our component is more or less the same as the hello-world component. To make it a bit more interesting, lets add some conditional rendering and only render our component on the company card.

To do this, lets modify our `render` method to check if the current context is `company`.

```tsx
public render() {
    if (this.context.limetype !== 'company') {
        return;
    }

    return 'Hello, CRM!';
}
```

Now, if we visit a company card we should se both "Hello, world!" and "Hello, CRM!" printed, but on all other cards, only "Hello, world!" is printed.

Let's make the component do something a bit more interesting than just rendering a string. Let's add a label displaying the name of the company, and a button that changes the name once it's been pressed.

## Connecting to the state

To get the name of the company we need to define a property on our component and connect it to the state.

```tsx
import { CurrentLimeobject } from '@limetech/lime-web-components-decorators';

export class HelloCrm implements LimeWebComponent {
    @CurrentLimeobject()
    @State()
    private company: object = {};

    ...
}
```

This will make the `company` property contain the current company from the context. To render the name, we simply have to modify our `render` method like so:

```tsx
public render() {
    ...
    return (
        <h2>Hello, {this.company['name']}!</h2>
    );
}
```

## Using the Core API

Let's also add a button to the `render` method that changes the name of the company once it has been pressed. To change the name, we are going to use the `http` service from the platform to call the Core API and change the name.

```tsx
public render() {
    ...
    return [
        <h2>Hello, {this.company['name']}!</h2>,
        <limel-button primary label="Click me!" onClick={this.handleClick.bind(this)} />
    ];
}
```

The `handleClick` method should look something like this

```tsx
private async handleClick() {
    const http = this.platform.get(PlatformServiceName.Http);
    await http.put(`api/v1/limeobject/company/${this.context.id}/`, {
        name: `Super ${this.company['name']}!`
    });
    console.log('Company name has been updated!');
}
```

Try it out and press the button. The name of the company is updated automatically!

## Track with User Statistics Service

Lets track to `Segment`, https://segment.com, when the name of the company has been changed.
To track this we are going to use the `UserStatistics` service from the platform.

The `handleClick` button from previous example will now also send a tracking event to `Segment`

```tsx
private async handleClick() {
    const http = this.platform.get(PlatformServiceName.Http);
    await http.put(`api/v1/limeobject/company/${this.context.id}/`, {
        name: `Super ${this.company['name']}!`
    });
    console.log('Company name has been updated!');

    const userStatistics = this.platform.get(PlatformServiceName.UserStatistics);
    userStatistics.sendTrackEvent('COMPANY_UPDATED' {
        'id': this.context.id,
        'name': this.company['name']
    });
}
```

Here we are also passing the `id` and the `name` of the company as properties with the tracking event.
